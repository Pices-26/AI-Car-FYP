# AI-Car-FYP
Final Year Project Code

### Code Written/Used on Jetson Nano  
main_car.py - Main/starting code from the Jetson Nano.  
camera.py - Responsible for camera control.  
con_py_test.py - Only code which I didn't write. Reproducing the code didn't make any sense for this purpose.  

### Code written/used on a Main Computer using Jupyter
custom model.ipynb - Custom written CNN model + reading data + processing data + training.  
ResNet50V2 tweaked model.ipynb - Tweaked ResNet50V2 model + reading data + processing data + training. (Code based on: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05440.pdf)

### Additional
custom model merging.ipynb - Read extended description of this file for explanation

### Rest of Experimental Code
data_augmentation.ipynb - Attempt to bin data + have the same amount of straight data as turning data (didn't perform well).  
img_preprocessing_test.ipynb - Code to play around with to create best image preprocessing.  
data_merging_attempt - Due to not having enough of straight line data, a straigh line track was made to gather only stright line data and combine it with track data (didn't perform well).
